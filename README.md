1. convert dataset  from Excel file to Csv file.
2. Data loading and Inpection.

- What are the top 4 products by total revenue?

### Data Analysis
code  that I worked with
```sql
SELECT*, COUNT(PRODUCT_ID) AS PRODUCT_SOLD, 
SUM(TRANSACTION_QTY*UNIT_PRICE) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT, 
COUNT(TRANSACTION_ID) AS NUMBER_of_sales,
to_char(TO_DATE(TRANSACTION_DATE, 'YYYY/MM/DD'), 'YYYYMM') AS MONTH_ID,
CASE
 WHEN TRANSACTION_TIME BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '11:59:59' THEN 'MORNING'
 WHEN TRANSACTION_TIME BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '15:59:59' THEN 'AFTERNOON'
 WHEN TRANSACTION_TIME BETWEEN '16:00:00' AND '18:59:59' THEN 'EVENING'
 ELSE 'NIGHT'
 END AS TRANSACTION_TIME_BUCKET
FROM
  BRIGHTLIGHTCOFFEE.PUBLIC.COFFEESHOP_SALES
